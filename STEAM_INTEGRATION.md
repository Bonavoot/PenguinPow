## What You Need to Do Next

### 1. **‚úÖ Steam App ID Complete!**

Great! I can see you already have your Steam App ID: `3793530`

### 2. **Running Your Game in Development**

**Complete Game Stack (Recommended):**

```bash
npm run dev:game
```

This starts:

- Game server (localhost:3001)
- React client (localhost:5173)
- Electron app with Steam integration

**Web Browser Only:**

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

This starts:

- Game server (localhost:3001)
- React client (localhost:5173)
  Then open: http://localhost:5173

**Manual Method:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the game server
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2: Start the React client
npm run dev:client

# Terminal 3: Start the Electron app
npm start
```

**Your PenguinPow multiplayer sumo game needs both:**

- **Frontend**: React client on port 5173
- **Backend**: Game server on port 3001 (handles multiplayer rooms, physics, Socket.IO)

### 3. **Testing Your Steam Integration**

1. **Development Testing:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

   - Check console for "[DEV]" Steam messages
   - All Steam features will be simulated
   - Look for messages like:
     - `[DEV] Steam API simulation enabled`
     - `[DEV] Achievement unlocked: FIRST_WIN`
     - `[DEV] Rich presence: In Sumo Match - Round 2/3`

2. **Production Testing:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   - Requires Steam client running
   - Uses real Steam API with App ID 3793530

### 4. **Steam Features Ready to Use**

#### In your React components:

```javascript
import SteamClient from "../steam/steamClient";

// Initialize Steam (call this when your game starts)
await SteamClient.initialize(3793530); // Your App ID

// Unlock achievements
await SteamClient.unlockAchievement("FIRST_WIN");

// Set player stats
await SteamClient.setStat("matches_played", 10);
await SteamClient.setStat("wins", 5);

// Set rich presence (shows what player is doing)
await SteamClient.setRichPresence("In Sumo Match", "Round 2/3");

// Create/join lobbies for multiplayer
const lobby = await SteamClient.createLobby(4);
await SteamClient.joinLobby(lobbyId);

// Take Steam screenshots
await SteamClient.takeScreenshot();
```
